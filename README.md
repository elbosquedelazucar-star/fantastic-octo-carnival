Bosque de Azúcar — Demo landing page
Files:
- index.html
- styles.css

Usage:
1. Open index.html in a browser to preview.
2. Replace the image placeholders with your own photos or licensed images.
3. IMPORTANT: If you want to use characters owned by Disney (or other copyrighted characters),
   obtain the appropriate license or permission. Do not publish copyrighted images without rights.
4. To connect the order form to a real backend, implement form submission handling (email/WhatsApp/api).

If you'd like, I can:
- generate royalty-free princess-inspired illustrations instead of copyrighted Disney characters,
- or create multiple color/theme variations,
- or produce print-ready menu graphics matching the website.
